'''
Swap the Last Chars in Dictionary Values
Write a function that swaps the last characters of the values corresponding to two specified keys in a dictionary.

Assume that the values in the dictionary are strings.

Input:
A dictionary d where the values are strings.
Two keys k1 and k2.
Output:
Modify the dictionary in-place by swapping the last characters of the values of the given keys.
The function returns None as it modifies the dictionary directly.
Assume the values for both keys k1 and k2 are non-empty strings and the dictionary contains the keys k1 and k2.

NOTE: This is a function type question, you don't have to take input or print the output, just have to complete the required function definition.

Examples

Example 1

>>> d = {"first": "apple", "second": "mango", "third":"banana"}
>>> swap_last_chars_of_values(d, "first", "second")
>>> d
{'first': 'applo', 'second': 'mange', "third": "banana"}
Example 2

>>> d = {"key1": "hello", "key2": "world"}
>>> swap_last_chars_of_values(d, "key1", "key2")
>>> d
{'key1': 'helld', 'key2': 'worlo'}
