Check Divisibility by Last Two Digits
Write a function that checks whether a given number is divisible by both of its last two digits.

Return False if any of the last two digits is zero.

NOTE: This is a function type question, you don't have to take input or print the output, just have to complete the required function definition.

Input: A positive integer num with at least two digits.
Output: True if the number is divisible by both of its last two digits, otherwise False.
Examples

1236 -> True, 1236 is divisible by both 3 and 6.
345 -> False, 345 is divisible by 5 but not divisible by 4.
748 -> False, 748 is divisible by 4 but not divisble by 8.
740 -> False, the last digit is 0.
