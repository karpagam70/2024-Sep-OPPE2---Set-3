Product of Sum and Absolute Difference of Digits in a Two-Digit Number
Given a two-digit number, calculate the product of:

The sum of its digits.
The absolute difference between its digits.
Assume the input is a two-digit number.

NOTE: This is a function type question, you don't have to take input or print the output, just have to complete the required function definition.

Input: A two-digit integer.
Output: An integer representing the product of the sum and absolute difference of its digits.

Example

Input

54
Output

9
Explanation

Digits are 5 and 4.
Sum = 5 + 4 = 9.
Absolute Difference = |5 - 4| = 1.
Product = 9 * 1 = 9.
